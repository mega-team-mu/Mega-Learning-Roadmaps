## Project (2 hours)

### Customer Churn Prediction

Build classification models to predict customer churn.

**Steps:**

1. Load customer dataset
2. Explore and preprocess data
3. Handle class imbalance if needed
4. Train Logistic Regression model
5. Train Decision Tree model
6. Compare using classification metrics
