## Theory (3 hours)

### Theory Topics

- What is Machine Learning?
- Types of learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)
- ML workflow and pipeline
- Understanding features and labels
- Training vs Testing data

---

## Practice (4 hours)

## Project (2 hours)

### House Price Prediction

Build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.

**Steps:**

1. Load and explore housing dataset
2. Preprocess and clean data
3. Split into training/testing sets
4. Train Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate with MSE and R² score
