## Project (2 hours)

### Binary Classification with Neural Networks

Build a neural network for binary classification.

**Dataset:** Sonar data (rock vs mine)

**Steps:**

1. Load Sonar dataset
2. Preprocess data
3. Build neural network from scratch (NumPy)
4. Build same network with Keras
5. Compare implementations
6. Evaluate performance
