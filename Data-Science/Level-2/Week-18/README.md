## Project (2 hours)

### Text Classification with Attention

Build an attention-based text classification model.

**Steps:**

1. Load text dataset
2. Preprocess text data
3. Implement attention layer
4. Build classification model
5. Train and evaluate
6. Visualize attention weights
7. Apply SHAP/LIME for interpretability
