## Task:

### **1. Idea Generation (Brainstorming)**

- Start with a **solo brainstorming session**.
- Pick a **specific problem or topic** within a product or service.
- **Write every idea or solution** that crosses your mind to improve the experience — don’t filter, judge, or analyze at this stage.
- Aim for **quantity over quality**, and keep it within a set time (around 15–20 minutes).

### **2. Organizing Ideas (Affinity Mapping)**

- Once you finish brainstorming, **sort the ideas by similarity**.
- Create **categories or clusters** and label each with a short, descriptive title.
- Keep grouping until you form a **clear visual map** that highlights how the ideas connect and support each other.
