## ✅ Task

### 1. Idea Generation (Brainstorming)

- Start with a **solo brainstorming session**
- Pick a **specific problem or topic** within a product or service
- **Write every idea or solution** that crosses your mind — don't filter, judge, or analyze at this stage
- Aim for **quantity over quality** (15–20 minutes)

### 2. Organizing Ideas (Affinity Mapping)

- Once you finish brainstorming, **sort the ideas by similarity**
- Create **categories or clusters** and label each with a short, descriptive title
- Keep grouping until you form a **clear visual map** that highlights how the ideas connect
