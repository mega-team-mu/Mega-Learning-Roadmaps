## ✅ Task

### Write a Problem Statement

Your statement should clearly explain:

- **What** specific problem they face
- **How** this problem negatively impacts their experience, work, or daily life

> **Example:** "Delivery app users often experience delays in receiving their orders due to unclear location tracking. This issue creates frustration, reduces trust in the service, and negatively impacts customer satisfaction."
