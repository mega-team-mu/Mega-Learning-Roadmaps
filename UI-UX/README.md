# UI/UX Circle

“ Every great designer was once a beginner. "

This circle teaches UI/UX design concepts including user research, wireframing, prototyping, and interface design across three levels.  
Each level is divided into weeks with learning objectives, content, tasks, and deliverables.

This UI/UX Roadmap was created with passion to guide, inspire and support everyone who dreams of starting their journey in design. 

Let’s start the journey together, a journey of a thousand miles starts with one step. 🚀
